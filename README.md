## Employee Compensation Analysis: Insights and Trends Using SQL Window Functions

### About the Dataset

- This dataset contains information on all active employees of the City of Chicago. It includes details such as employee names, departments, job titles, employment status (full-time or part-time), annual salaries for salaried employees, and hourly rates for hourly employees.

- For hourly employees, the dataset provides the hourly rate and working frequency (e.g., 40, 35, 20, or 10 hours per week) to enable users to estimate annual wages. However, actual annual wages may vary depending on the number of hours worked and the employee's seasonal status.

### Insights from the Data

- Departments with higher average salaries may represent areas requiring specialized expertise or senior-level roles.
Example: If a department shows significantly lower averages compared to others, it may indicate underfunding or inequity.

- Sharp changes in salary between ranks could indicate inconsistencies in pay scales or merit-based adjustments.
Departments with minimal salary differences may have standardized pay scales.
